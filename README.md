# Child Theme for OJS 3
The parent of this Child Theme is [Classic](https://github.com/pkp/classic). This Child Theme wish to provide a sidebar in the Issue part, after the annoucements/description of the issue, where to visualize the Custom Blocks (the Plugin Custom Block manager is needed!).
It provides also a different visualization for small devices.

(All in progress)
